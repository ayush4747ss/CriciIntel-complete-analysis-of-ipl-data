The dataset used in this analysis includes detailed information about IPL matches, such as:

Match ID
Date and venue of the match
Teams involved
Player performances (runs scored, wickets taken, etc.)
Types of dismissals
Extras (wide, no-ball, byes, leg-byes)


Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization
Plotly: For interactive visualizations


Key Analyses and Visualizations
